The `Rules4Worlds` mod is a library for fabric mod developers (currently only on 1.20.6). 
It enables you to create your own world specific gameruls including a config file with ease. 
You can even add you own implementation of the classes used in the library and without changing 
the others they should be incorporated seemlessly without additional effort.

If you want to know more about the mod and how to use it for your own mods check out the [wiki](https://github.com/EternalFlame06/Rules4Worlds/wiki)
