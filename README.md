`Rules4Worlds` is a library mod for fabric mod developers (currently only on 1.20.6). 
It enables you to create your own world specific gameruls including a config file with ease. 
You can even add you own implementation of the classes used in the library and without changing 
the others they should be incorporated seemlessly without additional effort.
